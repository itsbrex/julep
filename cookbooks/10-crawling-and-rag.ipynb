making intelligence more human shouldn't mean making engineering less rigorous While the world rushed to stack prompts and call it engineering, we chose to build something foundational We created the 8-Factor Agent methodology not because it was easy, but because AI development deserves real tools, real engineering, and real infrastructure We're engineers who believe the future of software will be built on AI - not as a collection of clever hacks, but as properly engineered systems with clear interfaces, predictable behavior, and production-grade reliability Julep isn't another abstraction layer or prompt management tool It's a complete rethinking of how AI applications should be built, tested, and scaled Our task language isn't another abstraction layer; it's a new way to think about AI workflows Our infrastructure isn't just about scaling; it's about bringing reliability and rigor to a field that sorely needs it Because taking the hard path to simple AI development isn't just our approach - it's our conviction that this is how it should be done We're building the foundation for AI's future, not chasing its hype * * * Dev Resources\\n[Docs](https://docs.julep.ai/)\\n[Get API

making intelligence more human shouldn't mean making engineering less rigorous While the world rushed to stack prompts and call it engineering, we chose to build something foundational We created the 8-Factor Agent methodology not because it was easy, but because AI development deserves real tools, real engineering, and real infrastructure We're engineers who believe the future of software will be built on AI - not as a collection of clever hacks, but as properly engineered systems with clear interfaces, predictable behavior, and production-grade reliability Julep isn't another abstraction layer or prompt management tool It's a complete rethinking of how AI applications should be built, tested, and scaled Our task language isn't another abstraction layer; it's a new way to think about AI workflows Our infrastructure isn't just about scaling; it's about bringing reliability and rigor to a field that sorely needs it Because taking the hard path to simple AI development isn't just our approach - it's our conviction that this is how it should be done We're building the foundation for AI's future, not chasing its hype * * * Dev Resources\\n[Docs](https://docs.julep.ai/)\\n[Get API

making intelligence more human shouldn't mean making engineering less rigorous While the world rushed to stack prompts and call it engineering, we chose to build something foundational We created the 8-Factor Agent methodology not because it was easy, but because AI development deserves real tools, real engineering, and real infrastructure We're engineers who believe the future of software will be built on AI - not as a collection of clever hacks, but as properly engineered systems with clear interfaces, predictable behavior, and production-grade reliability Julep isn't another abstraction layer or prompt management tool It's a complete rethinking of how AI applications should be built, tested, and scaled Our task language isn't another abstraction layer; it's a new way to think about AI workflows Our infrastructure isn't just about scaling; it's about bringing reliability and rigor to a field that sorely needs it Because taking the hard path to simple AI development isn't just our

It acts as the infrastructure between large language models (LLMs) and your software, providing support for long-term memory and multi-step process management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key features of Julep include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **8-Factor Agent Methodology**: This approach incorporates software engineering principles into AI development. It includes managing prompts as code, ensuring model independence, structured reasoning, workflow-based models, and full observability for effective debugging and improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Built-In Reliability**: Julep is equipped with self-healing capabilities such as automatic retries for failed steps, message resending, task recovery, error handling, and real-time monitoring to enhance reliability and manage errors efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Modular and Flexible Design**: By defining explicit interfaces for tool interactions, Julep ensures that capabilities are modular and maintainable. Additionally, it treats model providers as replaceable resources, allowing for flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complex Workflow Management**: The platform allows users to define multi-step tasks in YAML, incorporate decision trees, loops, and execute tasks in parallel, which is particularly beneficial for sophisticated AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Rapid Prototyping and Scalability**: With features designed for rapid prototyping, Julep lets users go from idea to demo quickly while its infrastructure supports scalability to handle millions of concurrent users.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Ease of Use**: Development times can be significantly reduced as Julep handles much of the infrastructure orchestration, allowing developers to focus on refining prompts and core functionalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julep also offers numerous resources for developers including documentation, SDKs for Python and JavaScript, and integrations with various APIs. For further exploration and integration instructions, you can visit their [documentation page](https://docs.julep.ai/) or explore their [API Playground](https://dev.julep.ai/api/docs). If you're interested in a demonstration, you can [book a demo](https://calendly.com/ishita-julep) with their team.\n",

      "WhatItShouldBe\n",
      "Two years ago, we started Julep with a simple belief: making intelligence more human shouldn't mean making engineering less rigorous While the world rushed to stack prompts and call it engineering, we chose to build something foundational We created the 8-Factor Agent methodology not because it was easy, but because AI development deserves real tools, real engineering, and real infrastructure We're engineers who believe the future of software will be built on AI - not as a collection of clever hacks, but as properly engineered systems with clear interfaces, predictable behavior, and production-grade reliability Julep isn't another abstraction layer or prompt management tool It's a complete rethinking of how AI applications should be built, tested, and scaled Our task language isn't another abstraction layer; it's a new way to think about AI workflows Our infrastructure isn't just about scaling; it's about bringing reliability and rigor to a field that sorely needs it Because taking the hard path to simple AI development isn't just our approach - it's our conviction that this is how it should be done We're building the foundation for AI's future, not chasing its hype * * * Dev Resources\n",
