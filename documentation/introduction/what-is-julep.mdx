## Overview

Julep is a powerful platform for creating AI agents that remember past interactions and can perform complex tasks. Unlike simple chatbots or linear AI workflows, Julep enables the creation of sophisticated agents that can:

- Maintain long-term memory across conversations
- Execute multi-step tasks with decision-making capabilities
- Integrate with numerous external tools and APIs
- Handle complex workflows with parallel processing

## Purpose

While many AI applications are limited to simple, linear chains of prompts and API calls with minimal branching, Julep is built to handle more complex scenarios which:

- Have multiple steps and decision points
- Make intelligent decisions based on model outputs
- Spawn parallel execution branches
- Utilize multiple tools and integrations
- Run for extended periods

## Key Differentiators

### Platform vs Library
Julep is a complete platform that includes:
- A specialized language for describing workflows
- A robust server infrastructure for running those workflows
- SDKs for seamless platform interaction

### Stateful vs Stateless
Unlike traditional AI frameworks, Julep maintains state through:
- Persistent sessions that remember context
- Long-term agent memory
- Ability to resume and continue tasks

### Complex Workflows
Julep excels at handling:
- Multi-step processes with conditional logic
- Parallel task execution
- Integration with multiple external services
- Long-running operations with automatic state management

### Enterprise Ready
Built with production use cases in mind:
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Automatic task management and orchestration
- Scalable architecture for high-load scenarios
- Security-first design principles
