## Core Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="🧠 Persistent AI Agents" icon="brain">
    Create agents that maintain context and remember information across multiple interactions. Agents can learn from past conversations and apply that knowledge to future tasks.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="💾 Stateful Sessions" icon="database">
    Keep track of conversation history and context across multiple interactions. Sessions can be paused, resumed, and maintain their state indefinitely.
  </Card>

  <Card title="🔄 Multi-Step Tasks" icon="arrows-spin">
    Build complex workflows with decision-making capabilities, loops, and conditional logic. Tasks can be as simple or as sophisticated as needed.
  </Card>

  <Card title="⏳ Task Management" icon="hourglass">
    Handle long-running tasks that can run indefinitely. Tasks are automatically managed, with built-in support for retries and error handling.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Advanced Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="🛠️ Built-in Tools" icon="wrench">
    Access a wide range of built-in tools and easily integrate with external APIs. Tools can be added to agents to extend their capabilities.
  </Card>

  <Card title="🔧 Self-Healing" icon="bandage">
    Automatic retry mechanisms for failed steps, message resending, and robust task management keep your workflows running smoothly.
  </Card>

  <Card title="📚 RAG Support" icon="books">
    Built-in support for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Use Julep's document store to build systems that can retrieve and utilize your own data.
  </Card>

  <Card title="🔌 Easy Integration" icon="plug">
    Seamlessly integrate with your existing infrastructure using our comprehensive SDKs for Python and Node.js.
