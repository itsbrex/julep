## Core Components

### Agents
- AI-powered entities backed by large language models (LLMs)
- Execute tasks and interact with users
- Maintain persistent state and memory
- Can be extended with tools and integrations

### Sessions
- Stateful interactions between agents and users
- Maintain context across multiple exchanges
- Support long-running conversations
- Handle context management automatically

### Tasks
- Multi-step, programmatic workflows
- Support various step types:
  - Prompts and LLM interactions
  - Tool calls and integrations
  - Conditional logic and loops
  - Parallel execution

### Tools
Four types of tool integrations:
1. **User-defined Functions**
   - Custom function signatures
   - Client-side execution
   - Flexible implementation

2. **System Tools**
   - Built-in platform capabilities
   - Direct access to Julep APIs
   - Automatic execution

3. **Built-in Integrations**
   - Pre-configured third-party tools
   - Server-side execution
   - Managed authentication

4. **Direct API Calls**
   - HTTP/REST endpoints
   - Custom API integration
   - Runtime parameter support

## Infrastructure Components

### Document Store
- Vector database for semantic search
- Document management system
- Support for various file types
- Automatic indexing and retrieval

### Task Execution Engine
- Distributed task processing
- State management
- Error handling and retries
- Parallel execution support

### API Layer
- RESTful API endpoints
- SDK support
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quotas

## Data Flow

1. **Client Interaction**
   - SDK or API calls initiate requests
   - Authentication and validation
   - Request routing

2. **Task Processing**
   - Task decomposition
   - Step execution
   - State management
   - Tool integration

3. **Response Handling**
   - Result aggregation
   - Error handling
   - Client notification
   - State persistence

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- API key-based access
- Role-based permissions
- Session management
- Token validation

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Secure communication
- Data isolation
- Access controls

### Monitoring
- Audit logging
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Usage analytics
