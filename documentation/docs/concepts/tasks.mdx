## Overview

Tasks are GitHub Actions-style workflows that define multi-step actions in Julep. Think of them as recipes that tell an agent exactly how to accomplish a goal. For example, a task might outline the steps to "Summarize a Research Paper" or "Debug a Code Issue".

## Components

A task consists of several key components which can be broadly classified into:

### Input Schema

```yaml
name: Summarize Document
description: Create a concise summary of any document
input_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    document_text:
      type: string
      description: The text to summarize
```

### Tools

Tools are functions that can be used by an agent to perform tasks. Julep supports a wide range of tools from Integrations to external API calls to custom deinfed functions.
More information on tools can be found [here](/docs/concepts/tools).

```yaml
tools:
  - name: internet_search
    description: Performs an internet search using Brave
    type: integration
    integration:
      provider: brave
      method: search
      setup:
        api_key: <BRAVE_API_KEY>
```

### Sub-Workflows

A task can be made up of multiple sub-workflows. These sub-workflows can be named and can be used to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces.

```yaml
name: Summarize Document
description: Create a concise summary of any document

sample_sub_workflow:
  - prompt: |-
      Tell me a joke about {{inputs[0].topic}}:

main:
- workflow: sample_sub_workflow
  arguments:
    topic: "'AI'"
```

### Steps

<Info>
  We use tasks and workflows interchangeably. They are the same except Julep's branding reflects tasks.
</Info>

#### Basic Steps

1. **Tool Call**: Runs a specified tool with given arguments
2. **Prompt**: Runs a prompt using a model
3. **Evaluate**: Runs Python expressions and uses the result as output
4. **Wait for Input**: Suspends execution and waits for user input
5. **Log**: Logs information during workflow execution


#### Data Operations

1. **Embed**: Embeds text for semantic operations
2. **Search**: Searches for documents in the agent's doc store
3. **Set**: Sets a value in the workflow's key-value store
4. **Get**: Retrieves a value from the workflow's key-value store

#### Control Flow

1. **Foreach**: Runs a step for every value from a list in serial order
2. **Map-reduce**: Runs a step for every value of the input list in parallel
3. **Parallel**: Executes multiple steps in parallel
4. **Switch**: Executes different steps based on a condition
5. **If-else**: Conditional step with then and else branches
6. **Sleep**: Pauses the workflow execution for a specified time
7. **Return**: Ends the current workflow and optionally returns a value
8. **Yield**: Switches to another named workflow
9. **Error**: Throws an error and exits the workflow

> You can learn more about workflow steps in the [Workflow Steps](/docs/advanced/types-of-task-steps) section.

### Context Variables

Tasks have access to three types of context:

#### Input Variables
Access input parameters:
```yaml
- prompt: "Hello {{inputs[0].user_name}}"
```

#### Step Results
Use outputs from previous steps:
```yaml
- evaluate: len(_.search_results)
- if: _.count > 0
```

#### Environment Context
Access agent and session data:
```yaml
- prompt: "Agent {{agent.name}} is helping you"
```

<Info>
  Input schemas help catch errors early by validating all inputs before execution starts.
</Info>

Here's how these components work together:

```yaml
name: Process Customer Feedback
description: Analyze and categorize customer feedback
input_schema:
  type: object
  required: ["feedback_text"]
  properties:
    feedback_text:
      type: string
    sentiment_analysis:
      type: boolean
      default: true

tools:
  - name: categorize
    integration:
      provider: classification
      method: categorize

main:
  - prompt: Analyze customer sentiment
  - tool: categorize
    arguments:
      text: inputs[0].feedback_text
```

> Learn more about tools [here](/docs/concepts/tools).

### Metadata

Metadata is a key-value pair that can be used to categorize and filter tasks.

## How to Use Tasks ?

### Creating a Task

Here's a simple task that summarizes a document and checks if the summary is too long. We first define the task in a YAML file and then create it using the Julep SDK.

<CodeGroup>


```yaml YAML
name: Summarize Document
description: Create a concise summary of any document
input_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    document_text:
      type: string
      description: The text to summarize

main:
  - prompt: |-
        Analyze the following text and create a summary:
        {{inputs[0].document_text}}
    unwrap: true
  - evaluate:
      too_long: len(_) > 500
  - if: _.too_long
    then:
      prompt: |-
        Make the summary more concise:
        {{outputs[0]}}
    else: 
      evaluate:
        content: outputs[0]
```

```python Python
# Create a task
import yaml
task_def = yaml.safe_load(task_yaml)
task = client.tasks.create(
    agent_id="agent_id",
    **task_def
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
    Check out the API reference [here](/api-reference/tasks) or SDK reference (Python [here](/sdks/python/reference#tasks) or JavaScript [here](/sdks/nodejs/reference#tasks) for more details on different operations you can perform on tasks.
</Tip>


### Executing a Task

Here's how to execute a task:

```python
# Execute a task
execution = client.executions.create(
    task_id=task.id,
    input={
        "document_text": "This is a sample document"
    }
)

# Monitor progress
while True:
    result = client.executions.get(execution.id)
    if result.status in ["succeeded", "failed"]:
        break
    time.sleep(1)
```

<Tip>
    Check out the API reference [here](/api-reference/executions) or SDK reference (Python [here](/sdks/python/reference#executions) or JavaScript [here](/sdks/nodejs/reference#executions) for more details on different operations you can perform on tasks.
</Tip>

## Relationship to Other Concepts

This section will help you understand how tasks relate to other concepts in Julep.

### Agents

Julep agents can power tasks by providing memory, context, or tools. Tasks are multi-step workflows designed for complex, automated execution. Whenever you create a task, you can associate it with an agent if you want to leverage that agent's capabilities. Unlike sessions, tasks are not meant for real-time interaction; they run through a defined workflow to achieve a goal.

For example:

```python
# Create an agent with specific tools
agent = client.agents.create(
    name="Customer Support Agent",
    tools=["email", "ticket_system"]
)

# Create a task that inherits these tools
task = client.tasks.create(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    name="Handle Support Request",
    main=[
        {"tool": "email", "arguments": {"to": "{{inputs.customer}}"}}
    ]
)
```

### Tools

Task can leverage tools to perform complex operations. Tools can be defined in the task definition or can be associated with an agent. 
When you define a tool in the task definition, it is available to all steps in that task only. On the other hand, when you associate a tool with an agent, it is available to all the Tasks associated with that agent.
