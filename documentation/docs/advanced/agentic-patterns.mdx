# Agentic Patterns

This guide covers common patterns and best practices for building effective Julep agents. Understanding these patterns will help you create more robust and capable AI agents.

## Task Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Processing
The most basic pattern where tasks are executed in a linear sequence. Common in data processing and content generation workflows.

Example from the Research Agent:

```yaml

```

### Parallel Processing
For tasks that can be executed concurrently to improve performance. Useful for batch operations like multiple API calls or data processing.

Example pattern:

```yaml


```

### Iterative Processing
For tasks that need to process items in a collection one at a time, often used with foreach loops.

Example from the Storytelling Agent:

```yaml

```

## State Management Patterns

### Context Preservation
Maintaining conversation context and agent state across multiple interactions. Uses Julep's session management capabilities.

Key components:
- Session situation tracking
- User context maintenance
- Conversation history management

Reference implementation:

```yaml


```


## Communication Patterns

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
Patterns for agents to work together and share information:

1. **Chain of Responsibility**
   - Agents pass tasks along a chain
   - Each agent handles specific aspects
   - Clear handoff protocols

2. **Hub and Spoke**
   - Central coordinator agent
   - Specialist agents for specific tasks
   - Aggregated results

### Tool Integration
Patterns for integrating external tools and APIs:

1. **API Wrapper Pattern**

```yaml

```

2. **Function Call Pattern**

```yaml

```

## Error Handling Patterns

### Graceful Degradation
Implement fallback mechanisms when primary approaches fail:

```yaml

```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Agent Roles**
   - Define specific purposes for each agent
   - Use descriptive names and about sections
   - Document agent capabilities and limitations

2. **Modular Task Design**
   - Break complex workflows into smaller tasks
   - Reuse common patterns across agents
   - Maintain clear input/output contracts

3. **Effective Prompting**
   - Use consistent system messages
   - Provide clear instructions
   - Include relevant context

4. **Resource Management**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Cache frequently used data
   - Monitor token usage

5. **Security Considerations**
   - Validate user inputs
   - Implement access controls
   - Handle sensitive data appropriately

These patterns represent common approaches seen across successful Julep implementations. Choose and adapt them based on your specific use case requirements.
