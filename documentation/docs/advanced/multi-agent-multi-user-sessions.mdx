## Behavior in Multi-Agent/User Sessions

### User Behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No User">
    - No user data is retrieved
    - (Upcoming) Memories are not mined from the session
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One or More Users">
    - Docs, metadata, memories, etc. are retrieved for all users in the session
    - Messages can be added for each user by referencing them by name in the `ChatML` messages
    - (Upcoming) Memories mined in the background are added to the corresponding user's scope
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Agent Behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="One Agent">
    - Works as expected
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple Agents">
    - When a message is received by the session, each agent is called one after another in the order they were defined in the session
    - You can specify which `agent` to use in a request, in which case, only that agent will be used
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  This multi-agent/user capability allows for sophisticated scenarios such as:
  - Collaborative problem-solving with multiple AI agents
  - Group conversations with multiple users and agents
  - Specialized agents working together on complex tasks
</Note>

<Tip>
  By supporting these various configurations, Julep provides a flexible framework for building diverse and powerful AI applications.
