## Core Components

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agent" icon="robot">
    <p>The main orchestrator of your application, backed by foundation models like GPT4 or Claude.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="User" icon="user">
    <p>Users can be associated with sessions and are used to scope memories formed by agents.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Session" icon="messages">
    <p>The main workhorse for Julep apps.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Tool" icon="wrench">
    <p>Programmatic interfaces that foundation models can "call" with inputs.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Doc" icon="file-lines">
    <p>Collections of text snippets indexed into a vector database.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Task & Execution" icon="list-check">
    <p>Github Actions-style workflows for complex operations.</p>
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Infrastructure Components

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Document Store" icon="database">
    <p>The document store provides a vector database for semantic search along with a document management system. It supports various file types and handles automatic indexing and retrieval of documents.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Task Execution Engine" icon="gears">
    <p>The task execution engine handles distributed task processing, state management, error handling with retries, and supports parallel execution of tasks.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="API Layer" icon="code">
    <p>The API layer provides RESTful API endpoints, SDK support, authentication and authorization capabilities, and handles rate limiting and quotas.</p>
  </Card>

<Info>
  <p>The data flow in Julep is divided into three main components, each handling specific aspects of request processing and response generation.</p>
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Client Interaction" icon="arrow-right-to-bracket">
    - SDK or API calls initiate requests
    - Authentication and validation
    - Request routing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Task Processing" icon="gears">
    - Task decomposition
    - Step execution
    - State management
    - Tool integration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Response Handling" icon="arrow-right-from-bracket">
    
    - Result aggregation
    - Error handling
    - Client notification
    - State persistence
  </Step>
</Steps>
