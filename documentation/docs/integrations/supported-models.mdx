## Connect Julep to LLMs

Julep leverages LiteLLM to seamlessly connect you to a wide array of Language Models (LLMs). This integration offers incredible flexibility, allowing you to tap into models from various providers with a straightforward, unified interface.

<Info>
With our unified API, switching between different providers is a breeze, ensuring you maintain consistent functionality across the board.
</Info>

## Available Models

<Info>
While we provide API keys for quick testing and development, you'll need to use your own API keys when deploying to production. This ensures you have full control over your usage and billing.
</Info>

<Tip>
Looking for top-notch quality? Our curated selection of models delivers excellent outputs for all your use cases.

## Supported Parameters

<Info>
These parameters let you tweak the model's behavior to suit your needs. Keep in mind, not every parameter is supported by all models.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generation Parameters" icon="sliders">
    | Parameter | Range | Default | Description |
    |-----------|--------|---------|-------------|
    | temperature | 0.0 - 5.0 | None | Controls randomness in outputs. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) increase randomness, lower values (e.g., 0.2) make output more focused |
    | max_tokens | ≥ 1 | None | Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response |
    | top_p | 0.0 - 1.0 | None | Controls nucleus sampling - only tokens with cumulative probability < top_p are considered |
    | frequency_penalty | -2.0 - 2.0 | None | Penalizes frequent tokens. Positive values reduce repetition |
    | presence_penalty | -2.0 - 2.0 | None | Penalizes tokens based on presence in text so far |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced Parameters" icon="gear">
    | Parameter | Range | Default | Description |
    |-----------|--------|---------|-------------|
    | repetition_penalty | 0.0 - 2.0 | None | Penalizes repetition (1.0 is neutral) |
    | length_penalty | 0.0 - 2.0 | None | Penalizes based on generation length (1.0 is neutral) |
    | min_p | 0.0 - 1.0 | None | Minimum probability threshold for token consideration |
    | seed | -1 - 1000 | None | For deterministic generation |
    | stream | boolean | false | Enable streaming of responses |
    | stop | list[str] (max 4) | [] | Sequences where generation should stop |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response Formatting" icon="code">
    You can control how the model outputs its responses using the `response_format` parameter:
    
    - `text` (default): Free-form text output
    - `json_object`: Structured JSON output
    - `json_schema`: Custom schema-based output
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Model Selection Guidelines" icon="magnifying-glass">
    <Note>
    When picking a model, think about:
    - Your budget and cost constraints
    - How fast you need responses
    - The quality you’re aiming for
    - The context window size you require
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Best Practices" icon="lightbulb">
    - Start with smaller models for development and testing
    - Use larger context windows only when necessary
    - Keep an eye on token usage to manage costs
  </Accordion>
