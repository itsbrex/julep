# Video Processing

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to:
- Upload and process videos using Cloudinary integration
- Extract and analyze video content
- Add overlays and transformations
- Process video subtitles and speaker information

## Task Structure

Let's break down the task into its core components:

### 1. Input Schema

First, we define what inputs our task expects:

```yaml
input_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    upload_file:
      type: string
      description: The url of the file to upload
    public_id:
      type: string
      description: The public id of the file to upload
    transformation_prompt:
      type: string
      description: The prompt for the transformations to apply to the file
    subtitle_vtt:
      type: string
      description: The vtt file content to add subtitles to the video
```

This schema specifies that our task expects:
- A video file URL
- A public ID for the video
- A transformation prompt describing desired changes
- VTT subtitle content (optional)

### 2. Tools Configuration

Next, we define the external tools our task will use:

```yaml
- name: cloudinary_upload
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: cloudinary
    method: media_upload
    setup:
      cloudinary_api_key: YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
      cloudinary_api_secret: YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
      cloudinary_cloud_name: YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME

- name: cloudinary_edit
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: cloudinary
    method: media_edit

- name: ffmpeg_edit
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: ffmpeg
```

We're using three main integrations:
- Cloudinary for video uploads and transformations
- FFmpeg for additional video processing capabilities

### 3. Main Workflow Steps

#### Step 1: Initial Video Upload

```yaml
- tool: cloudinary_upload
  arguments:
    file: '_0.upload_file'
    public_id: '_0.public_id'
    upload_params:
      resource_type: "'video'"
```

This step:
- Takes the input video URL
- Uploads it to Cloudinary
- Specifies the resource type as video

#### Step 2: Create Video Preview

```yaml
- tool: cloudinary_upload
  arguments:
    file: '_0.upload_file'
    public_id: '_0.public_id'
    upload_params:
      resource_type: "'video'"
      transformation:
        - start_offset: "0"
          end_offset: "30"
```

This step:
- Creates a 30-second preview of the video
- Useful for quick analysis and processing

#### Step 3: Analyze Video Content

```yaml
- prompt:
  - role: user
    content: 
      - type: image_url
        image_url:
          url: "{{trimmed_video_url}}"
      - type: text
        text: |-
          Which speakers are speaking in the video? And where does each of them sit?
```

This step:
- Analyzes the video content
- Identifies speakers and their positions
- Uses VTT subtitles for additional context

#### Step 4: Generate Speaker Transformations

```yaml
- evaluate:
    speakers_transformations: |-
      [
      transform
      for speaker in _.speakers_json
        for transform in [
        {
          "overlay": {"font_family": "Arial", "font_size": 32, "text": speaker.speaker},
          "color": "white"
        },
        {
          "duration": 5,
          "flags": "layer_apply",
          "gravity": "south_east" if speaker.position == "right" else "south_west",
          "start_offset": speaker.timestamps[0].start,
          "y": 80,
          "x": 80
        }
        ]
      ]
```

This step:
- Creates transformations for each speaker
- Adds speaker labels with proper positioning
- Sets timing for each overlay

#### Step 5: Apply Transformations

```yaml
- tool: cloudinary_upload
  arguments:
    file: '_0.upload_file'
    public_id: '_0.public_id'
    upload_params:
      resource_type: "'video'"
      transformation: _.speakers_transformations
```

This step:
- Uses the Cloudinary upload tool to apply the generated transformations
- Processes the video with speaker labels and positioning
- Returns a URL to the transformed video with all overlays applied

Note: While this step uses the `cloudinary_upload` tool, its primary purpose is to apply the transformations rather than just uploading the video. When you upload a video with transformations specified, Cloudinary processes these transformations and returns a URL to the processed video.


## Example Usage

Here's how to use this task with the Julep SDK:

```python
from julep import Client

client = Client(api_key=JULEP_API_KEY)

execution = client.executions.create(
    task_id=TASK_UUID,
    input={
        "upload_file": "https://example.com/sample-video.mp4",
        "public_id": "video_test",
        "subtitle_vtt": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:28.509\nSpeaker: Hello...",
        "transformation_prompt": "Add a logo overlay to top-left corner"
    }
)
```

## Next Steps

To try this task yourself:
1. Get your API keys for Cloudinary
2. Create a new agent using the Julep SDK
3. Create and execute the task with your video file
4. Experiment with different transformations and analyses
