## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to:
- Set up browser automation with Julep
- Navigate web pages programmatically 
- Execute browser actions like clicking and typing
- Process visual feedback through screenshots
- Create goal-oriented browser automation tasks

## Task Structure

Let's break down the task into its core components:

### 1. Input Schema

First, we define what inputs our task expects:

```yaml
input_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    goal:
      type: string
    agent_id:
      type: string
      description: The id of the agent to use for the browser automation
  required:
    - goal
    - agent_id
```

This schema specifies that our task expects a goal string describing what the browser automation should accomplish.

### 2. Tools Configuration

Next, we define the external tools our task will use:

```yaml
tools:
- name: create_browserbase_session
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: browserbase
    method: create_session
    setup:
      api_key: YOUR_BROWSERBASE_API_KEY
      project_id: YOUR_PROJECT_ID

- name: get_session_view_urls
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: browserbase
    method: get_live_urls

- name: perform_browser_action
  type: integration
  integration:
    provider: remote_browser
    method: perform_action
    setup:
      width: 1024
      height: 768

- name: create_julep_session
  type: system
  system:
    resource: session
    operation: create

- name: session_chat
  type: system
  system:
    resource: session
    operation: chat
```

### 3. Main Workflow Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Julep Session">
    ```yaml
    - tool: create_julep_session
      arguments:
        agent: str(agent.id)
        situation: "'The environment is a browser'"
        recall: 'False'
    ```

    This step initializes a new Julep session for the AI agent. The session serves as a container for the conversation history and enables the agent to maintain context throughout the interaction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Session ID">
    ```yaml
    - evaluate:
        julep_session_id: _.id
    ```
    After creating the session, we store its unique identifier for future reference.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Browser Session">
    ```yaml
    - tool: create_browserbase_session
      arguments:
        project_id: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    ```
    This step establishes a new browser session using BrowserBase. It creates an isolated, headless Chrome browser instance that the agent can control.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Browser Session Info">
    ```yaml
    - evaluate:
        browser_session_id: _.id
        connect_url: _.connect_url
    ```
    We store both the browser session ID and connect URL in a single evaluation step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Session View URLs">
    ```yaml
    - tool: get_session_view_urls
      arguments:
        id: _.browser_session_id
    ```
    This step retrieves various URLs associated with the browser session, including debugging interfaces and live view URLs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Store Debugger URL">
    ```yaml
    - evaluate:
        debugger_url: _.urls.debuggerUrl
    ```
    We specifically store the debugger URL, which provides access to Chrome DevTools Protocol debugging interface.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initial Navigation">
    ```yaml
    - tool: perform_browser_action
      arguments:
        connect_url: outputs[3].connect_url
        action: "'navigate'"
        text: "'https://www.google.com'"
    ```
    This step navigates to Google's homepage to avoid sending a blank screenshot when computer use starts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Browser Workflow">
    ```yaml
    - workflow: run_browser
      arguments:
        julep_session_id: outputs[1].julep_session_id
        cdp_url: outputs[3].connect_url
        messages:
        - role: "'user'"
          content: |-
            """
            <SYSTEM_CAPABILITY>
            * You are utilising a headless chrome browser to interact with the internet.
            * You can use the computer tool to interact with the browser.
            * You have access to only the browser.
            * You are already inside the browser.
            * You can't open new tabs or windows.
            * For now, rely on screenshots as the only way to see the browser.
            * You can't don't have access to the browser's UI.
            * YOU CANNOT WRITE TO THE SEARCH BAR OF THE BROWSER.
            </SYSTEM_CAPABILITY>
            <GOAL>
            *""" + inputs[0].goal + NEWLINE + "</GOAL>"
    ```
    Finally, we initiate the interactive browser workflow with system capabilities and user goal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Run Browser Workflow

The `run_browser` workflow is a crucial component that handles the interactive browser automation. It consists of three main parts:

<Step title="Agent Interaction">
  ```yaml
  - tool: session_chat
    arguments:
      session_id: _.julep_session_id
      messages: _.messages
      recall: 'False'
  ```
  This step engages the AI agent in conversation, allowing it to:
  - Process and understand the user's goal
  - Plan appropriate browser actions
  - Generate responses based on the current browser state
  - Make decisions about next steps
</Step>

<Step title="Action Execution">
  ```yaml
  - foreach:
      in: _.tool_calls
      do:
        tool: perform_browser_action
        arguments:
          connect_url: inputs[0].cdp_url
          action: _.action
          text: _.get('text')
          coordinate: _.get('coordinate')
  ```
  This component:
  - Iterates through planned actions sequentially
  - Executes browser commands (navigation, clicking, typing)
  - Handles different types of interactions (text input, mouse clicks)
  - Captures screenshots for visual feedback
</Step>

<Step title="Goal Evaluation">
  ```yaml
  - workflow: check_goal_status
    arguments:
      messages: _.messages
      julep_session_id: _.julep_session_id
      cdp_url: _.cdp_url
  ```
  This final part:
  - Assesses progress toward the user's goal
  - Determines if additional actions are needed
  - Maintains conversation context
  - Decides whether to continue or conclude the workflow
</Step>

## Check Goal Status Workflow

The `check_goal_status` workflow is a recursive component that ensures continuous operation until the goal is achieved:

<Step title="Check Goal Status">
  ```yaml
  check_goal_status:
  - if: len(_.messages) > 0
    then:
      workflow: run_browser
      arguments:
        messages: _.messages
        julep_session_id: _.julep_session_id
        cdp_url: _.cdp_url
        workflow_label: "'run_browser'"
  ```
</Step>

  This workflow:
  - Checks if there are any messages to process (`len(_.messages) > 0`)
  - If messages exist, recursively calls the `run_browser` workflow
  - Passes along the current session context and connection details
  - Maintains the conversation flow until the goal is achieved
  - Automatically terminates when no more messages need processing

  This recursive pattern ensures that the browser automation continues until either:
  - The goal is successfully achieved
  - No more actions are needed
  - An error occurs that prevents further progress

## Example Usage

Here's how to use this task with the Julep SDK:

```python
from julep import Client

client = Client(api_key=JULEP_API_KEY)

execution = client.executions.create(
    task_id=TASK_UUID,
    input={
        "agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID",
        "goal": "Search for recent news about artificial intelligence"
    }
)
```

## Key Features

- **Browser Automation**: Performs web interactions like navigation, clicking, and typing
- **Visual Feedback**: Captures screenshots to verify actions and understand page state
- **Goal-Oriented**: Continues executing actions until the user's goal is achieved
- **Secure Sessions**: Uses BrowserBase for isolated browser instances
- **Interactive Workflow**: Uses run_browser subworkflow for continuous interaction

## Next Steps

To try this task yourself:
1. Get your API keys for BrowserBase
2. Create a new agent using the Julep SDK
3. Create and execute the task with your desired goal
4. Experiment with different browser automation scenarios
