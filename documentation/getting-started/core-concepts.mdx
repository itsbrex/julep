## Core Concepts

Understanding Julep's core concepts is essential for building effective AI applications. This guide covers the fundamental components and how they work together.

### Agents

Agents are AI-powered entities that can perform tasks and interact with users. They are the central building blocks of Julep applications.

```python
agent = client.agents.create(
    name="Customer Service Agent",
    model="claude-3.5-sonnet",
    about="An AI assistant that helps with customer inquiries"
)
```

Key aspects of agents:
- **Identity**: Each agent has a name and description that defines its role
- **Model**: The underlying language model (e.g., Claude, GPT-4)
- **Memory**: Ability to maintain context across interactions
- **Tools**: Access to various capabilities through integrated tools

### Tasks

Tasks are multi-step workflows that agents can execute. They define a sequence of actions to achieve a specific goal.

```yaml
name: Process Customer Inquiry
description: Handle a customer question and provide a response

main:
  - prompt:
      - role: system
        content: "You are a customer service agent."
      - role: user
        content: "{{inputs.question}}"
  
  - tool: search_knowledge_base
    arguments:
      query: "{{_.content}}"
  
  - prompt:
      - role: system
        content: "Use this information to answer: {{_.search_results}}"
      - role: user
        content: "{{inputs.question}}"
```

Key aspects of tasks:
- **Structure**: Defined sequence of steps
- **Steps Types**: Various actions like prompts, tool calls, and control flow
- **Context**: Access to inputs and previous step results
- **Tools**: Integration with external services and APIs

### Sessions

Sessions maintain the state and context of interactions between users and agents.

```python
session = client.sessions.create(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    user_id=user.id,
    context_overflow="adaptive"
)

response = client.sessions.chat(
    session_id=session.id,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

Key aspects of sessions:
- **State Management**: Maintains conversation history
- **Context**: Preserves relevant information across interactions
- **Memory**: Handles long-term and working memory
- **User Association**: Links conversations to specific users

### Tools

Tools extend an agent's capabilities by providing access to external functionality.

```yaml
tools:
  - name: search_knowledge_base
    type: integration
    integration:
      provider: elasticsearch
      setup:
        endpoint: "https://search.example.com"
        index: "knowledge_base"
```

Types of tools:
1. **User-defined Functions**: Custom functions you implement
2. **System Tools**: Built-in Julep API operations
3. **Integrations**: Pre-built third-party service connections
4. **API Calls**: Direct external API interactions

### Executions

Executions are instances of tasks being run with specific inputs.

```python
execution = client.executions.create(
    task_id=task.id,
    input={"question": "How do I reset my password?"}
)

# Monitor execution status
while execution.status not in ['succeeded', 'failed']:
    execution = client.executions.get(execution.id)
```

Key aspects of executions:
- **State**: Tracks progress and status
- **Input/Output**: Manages data flow
- **History**: Records step-by-step execution
- **Error Handling**: Manages failures and retries

### Documents

Documents store information that agents can reference during tasks.

```python
document = client.agents.docs.create(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    title="Product Manual",
    content="Detailed product information...",
    metadata={"category": "documentation"}
)

# Search documents
results = client.agents.docs.search(
    agent_id=agent.id,
    text="password reset",
    metadata_filter={"category": "documentation"}
)
```

Key aspects of documents:
- **Storage**: Persistent knowledge base
- **Search**: Semantic search capabilities
- **Metadata**: Additional context and categorization
- **Versioning**: Document history and updates

### Putting It All Together

Here's how these concepts work together in a typical Julep application:

1. Create an **Agent** with specific capabilities
2. Define **Tasks** the agent can perform
3. Use **Tools** to extend functionality
4. Maintain context with **Sessions**
5. Store knowledge in **Documents**
6. Run **Executions** to complete tasks
